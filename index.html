        <h3>Junglist Soldiers</h3>

        <p>Far and wide as the eye can wander
            Street and law are everywhere
            The Cheeky Crew sang out to greet us
            Picked up the pace, we were mashing up the place
            When we felt a Ruckus bass

        </p>

        <p>We are the Junglist Soldiers
            We're marching into the dance hall
            Here we come, here we come

            Up and down, the police are pacing
            No one, no one can break free
            Flight would mean just another arrest facing
            Guns and barbed wire greet our view
        </p>
        <p>We are the Junglist Soldiers
            We're marching into the dance hall
            Here we come, here we come
            But for us there is no complaining
            Winter will in time be passed
            Then once more we will stand rejoicing
            Homeland dear you are ours at last</p>
